Term paper guidelines\\

\hrule
Your term paper for this course should be a scientific review that focuses on the coupling(s) between two or more components of the Earth system. You are free to choose the topic, but try to either focus on (1) the details of a specific coupling or feedback loop (e.g., How does erosion affect atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations?) or (2) a specific, preferably regional scale, phenomenon (e.g., Asian monsoons). Due to the nature of the course, we are forced to cover a wide variety of topics in a short amount of time. The idea with this paper is for you to explore in detail some topic that you are interested in. 

The paper should include, at a minimum, the following sections:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep -5pt
\item {\bf Title:} Make it specific, informative, and brief.
\item {\bf Abstract:} In 200 words or less (and yes, I will count the number of words), describe the key findings of the paper. Do not use a passive voice, and do not use the abstract to provide background material.
\item {\bf Introduction:} Provide background material on your topic and describe how it fits into Earth's climate system. State the goal or thesis of your paper. The introduction should be short (1--2 pages) and concise. In the introduction you are trying to bring readers up to speed with the ``thesis'' (i.e., objective) of the paper and explain why it is important. 
\item {\bf Body:} Synthesize ideas from the papers that you read to build a coherent thesis. Figure out your thesis before you start writing, and then build thediscussion toward that thesis. This is where an outline will be very useful, as will judicious use of section headings.
\item {\bf Conclusions:} Restate the thesis of the paper and reiterate the major conclusions/ideas of the paper.
\end{itemize}

In terms of writing, I often find that its best to write the body of the paper first, followed by the introduction and conclusions. Save the title and abstract for the end once you know what exactly your paper is about. Do not take the title and abstract lightly. They are the most important part of any scientific article, because they are what readers will use to determine whether or not to continue reading the article. In terms of reading articles, most people will read the title and abstract, then look at figures, then read the conclusions and introduction. If they are really interested in the material they will also read the methods and results. Keep this in mind when writing your article. If you think something is important, put it somewhere that people will see it.

Use a consistent style for sections, captions, and references throughout the paper; I suggest mimicking the style of a scientific journal. The paper should be 15 pages double-spaced and in 12 pt font, not including references. Of the 15 pages, no more than 3 pages can be used for figures. The internet is a good source of information, especially when starting on a paper; however, your paper must rely exclusively on primary literature (articles from scientific journals and textbooks). You should reference \textit{at least} five scientific articles and preferably closer to ten articles. If you are unsure whether an article is primary literature, please come talk with me.

Please carefully proofread your paper and include all cited references (but do not include articles in the references list that are not referenced in the paper). If you need help with writing, you can work with a tutor in the Writing Center. I am also happy to read through drafts of your paper and give you feedback, although I won't go through line-by-line to make sure that the grammar is perfect.

Being able to write clear, convincing arguments is extremely important in all fields of study. It is well worth your time to revise your term paper multiple times. Two final suggestions for making sure that your paper reads nicely: (1) read your paper aloud and (2) chop unnecessary words.

Term paper proposals\\

\hrule
You will be required to submit a proposal for your term paper by the end of the first month of the semester. The purpose for this is to ensure that the topic you have selected is relevant to the course and is of appropriate scope. It will also help you get started on your paper early in the semester.

Grading criteria (10 pts):

\begin{itemize}\itemsep -5pt \squeezeup
  \item thesis/objective (3 pts)
  \item 1 page description of topic (4 pts)
  \item 3--5 references (3 pts)

Term paper presentations\\

\hrule
You will be presenting your term papers in a 12--15 minute talk during the final class period. Treat the presentation as if you were presenting a research project at a conference. 12--15 minutes is not a lot of time, so you will need to think carefully about how to organize and present your topic. You should be well prepared so that you can talk comfortably and with confidence.

Your goal in a presentation like this is to capture the audience's attention and explain to them why your topic is interesting and relevant. In other words, don't simply read notes word-for-word. This is boring and indicates that you aren't familiar with the subject. I find that the best presentations are the ones in which the presenter (1) emphasizes a few main points and (2) tells a ``scientific story''. Too much detail and the audience may lose focus; not enough detail and the the story is hard to follow. Don't worry about justifying all of your arguments unless there are some important arguments that need to be made (and haven't been made previously). Obviously, there is some gray area here. Giving good presentations takes a lot of practice.

Many people start their presentations with an outline slide. I'm not a huge fan of outline slides---for short scientific talks, anyway---because they take up too much time and often only say that the topic is going to be introduced and some conclusions are going to be drawn. That said, it is a good idea to give the audience a general idea of where you are going with the talk. (I sometimes like to give away the punchline at the beginning of the talk by saying something like ``In this talk I will demonstrate...'') Make sure that you have some important conclusions at the end, but just focus on two or three of the most important parts of your project. Keep in mind that your audience likely doesn't understand your subject as well as you do.
